# ConfigRepo

Contains the configuration for the config server for microservice-a, microservice-b and the react-app <br />
For this configuration to work we need to setup environment variable called ```ENVIRONMENT``` and we set it to ```dev```, ```staging``` or ```prod``` (depending on the environment)
